# My Mother's Kitchen

A collection of my Mother's old and new recipes (mostly the Pakistani ones because they are stored in her head and I need documentation of them)

## Project Status

This project is a work in progress. I am currrently building the frontend pages and temporarily using the Edamam api for recipes. Once the frontend is complete I will create my own api and set up a database so I can display my own recipe data.
