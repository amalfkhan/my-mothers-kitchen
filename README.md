# My Mother's Kitchen

A collection of my Mother's recipes, most of which are only stored in her head. The motivation behind creating this was to not only have a database of her recipes, but also easily be able to generate a intuitive grocery list based on the recipes selected for a given week's mealplan.

**Tools:** React/JavaScript, Node.js/Express, mongoDB/mongoose
